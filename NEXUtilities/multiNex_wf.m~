% function to extract waveforms from multiple nex files that are
% continuations of each other (files broken up for memory purposes in
% offline sorter)

% INPUT:
% filenames - cell array of filenames to load
% varname - variable to load
% breakTimes - times at which the file was broken. breakTimes should have
%   one fewer element than filenames. breakTimes(1) = time at which first
%   file ends and second file begins
